I've started my first Guile Scheme app. It is a small generator of blog.
You can see the result this small post that I wrote here.
</p>

<p>
I thought about writing small app to learn Scheme - Lisp derivative.
I was aquainted already with Clojure (another Lisp derivative), so
parenthesis and list wasn't novelty for me, but it was not what I expected.
It wasn't bad, but it meant getting used to another idea for the development,
different toolset and libraries.
</p>

<p>
I know that there are other, more sophisticated Scheme implementations
like Racket, but Guile felt to me lighter and the module system was more
like I was used to already. There was even a HTTP client and server
in the standard library :).
</p>

<p>
GNU Guile is available almost in every Linux distribution and on MacOS X.
It is just one command to install it:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">&lt;your apt/yum/pacman/brew&gt; install guile
</pre>
